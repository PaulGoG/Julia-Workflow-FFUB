Different methods for partitioning the Total Excitation Energy (TXE) between the 
light and heavy fission fragments:
1. Modelling at scission using extra-deformation energies of the fragments (difference between 
deformation energy at scission and deformation energy at total acceleration of the fragments)

Others to be added soon
